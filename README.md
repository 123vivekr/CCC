## Getting started :
This is a colloborative program for competitive coding, from scratch, till: Well let's say _advanced_. Multiple lanugages.

## To-do 
- [ ] Complete the [Read-me.md](/README.md) documentation.
- [ ] Add all the contributors and add them to the Read-me documentation.
- [ ] Create the file structure boiler plate to start pushing code. 
- [ ] Update contribution guidelines with file name syntax and code guidelines in [contributing.md](/contributing.md). 
- [ ] Clean up the Read-me files inside each folder created for file structure purposes and replace them with proper documentation with links for the coding questions pushed.  

## Git
New to Git? No worries. Assuming you have created an account and reading this, go ahead and download the CLI interface for GIT, [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 
Don't like the CLI interface? Then try out the GUI version powered by electron [here](https://desktop.github.com/).
After the installation, do these steps: 

``` 
$ git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
$ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
```
## Coding 
- C/C++
  - Install [TCC-MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) compiler for executing and compiling C and C++ files.
  - Set the path to the bin of TCC by going to *Environment variables* and adding a new path.
  - Open command line and run the commands `gcc -o outputfile filename.c` and `outputfilename.exe` for C.
  - Respectively for C++, `g++ -o outputfile filename.cpp` and `outputfilename.exe`. _This is for compilation and execution._
- Java 
  - Install the latest [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html) and set path to bin.
  
  - _**Disclaimer: JDK 11 cannot be used for professional use. Stick with JDK 8 for avoiding your application from getting stripped down.**_
  - Setting path is easy as this - `C:\Guru> set path=%path%;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_101\bin`. _Run this in cmd._
  - Open command line and run `C:\Guru> javac filename.java` and `C:\Guru> java filename`.
  - _Important: Rename `.java` files to the respective class names `(Having PSVM)` or vice-versa for compilation._
- Python 
  - Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for _Windows._
  - Set the path and enter `python` in cmd to enter the python shell.
  - To execute a script file run `python filename.py`.
