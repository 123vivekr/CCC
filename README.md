## Git
New to Git? No worries. Assuming you have created an account and reading this, go ahead and download the CLI interface for GIT, [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 
Don't like the CLI interface? Then try out the GUI version powered by electron [here](https://desktop.github.com/).
After the installation, do these steps: 

``` 
$ git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
$ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
```
